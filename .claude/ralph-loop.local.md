You are building this project based on the PRD.
Skills to use:
- Read frontend-design for design quality guidelines
- Read software-engineering if available for code best practices
WORKFLOW:
1. Read the PRD and progress.txt carefully
2. Find the NEXT INCOMPLETE TASK (marked with [ ])
3. Implement that ONE task completely
4. Run checks: typecheck and lint
5. Commit and update BOTH files:
   - PRD.md: Change [ ] to [x] for the completed task
   - progress.txt: Add task number, timestamp, and notes
6. Follow to the next task until finish all
If ALL tasks complete, output: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
